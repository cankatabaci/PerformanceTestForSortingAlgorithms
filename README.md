# Performance Test For Sorting Algorithms

This project is a homework made in the course of Data Structures. 
Purposes of the project; Buble, Selection, Heap, Quick and Insertion Sort sorting algorithms to compare their performance. 7 different series including 100, 750, 1500, 7500, 15000, 75000 and 150000 random elements were produced.

### Sorting Performances

5 Different sorting algorithms were compared with 7 different data sets and the results were obtained as follows.

### Total working time(millisecond) by value ranges
